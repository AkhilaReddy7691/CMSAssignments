            GUIDE- WEB SCRAPPING SCRIPT FOR BOOKS TO SCRAPE
1. Prerequisites
Before running the script, install  the required libraries:
--> pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
requests-> fetches web page content
BeautifulSoup-> extracts specific data from the HTML
pandas-> saves extracted data into a CSV file

2. How the Script Works
Step 1: Import required libraries
The script begins by importing necessary modules.
import requests
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
Step 2: Define the target website
The website URL is stored in a variable.
URL="http://books.toscrape.com"
Step 3: Fetch the website content
The script fetches the web page using get function.
response=requests.get(url,timeout=10)
response.raise_for_status()
Step 4: Parse the HTML content
BeautifulSoup is used to read and extract data from the HTML page.
soup=BeautifulSoup(response.text,"html.parser")
Step 5: Extract Book data
Each book is inside an <article> tag  with the class "product_pod". The script loops through them and extracts:
Title-> Found inside the <h3> tag.
Price-> Extracted from <p> with class "price_color".
Availability-> Extracted from <p> with class "instock availability".
books_data=[]
for book in books:
            title=book.h3.a["title"]
            price=book.find("p",class_="price_color").text
            availability=book.find("p",class_="instock availability").text.strip()
            books_data.append({"Title": title, "Price": price, "Availability": availability})
Step 6: Save the data to a CSV File
Once data is extracted, it is stored in a CSV file using pandas.
df=pd.DataFrame(books_data
df.to_csv("scraped_books.csv",index=False)        
print("Scraping completed! Data saved to scraped_books.csv")
The CSV file is created in the same folder as the script.

3. Running the Script
Save the script as webscrapping.py.
Run the script in a terminal or command prompt:
            --> python webscrapping.py
Check the CSV file in the script directory.
Open scraped_books.csv in Excel or Notepad.

4. Expected Output
